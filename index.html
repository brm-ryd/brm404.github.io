									<p>As a person i love to learn new things especially related with open source technology. To know more about people is also part of my journey as in my past experience i interact a lot with people from end users to customers, simply to help them with the tech we used in our environment, hear for their difficulties and needs, and do the best to help. Never thought myself as an expert, only as journeyman who need to always learn, self improve skills, characters, and collaborate more with others - with that i believe i can be a better individual, more productive and innovative in what i do.</p>

									<h3>Raisely Team Q&A</h3>
									<p>Below are my thoughts regarding Raisely team questions (hope you don't mind with the thoughts - cheers!).</p>
									<div class="features">
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Why would i'd be a good fit for the Customer Success Engineer role?  
</h4>
												<p>I love helping people regarding technical difficulties due i can learn from the issue and get some satisfaction when i can help them solve the issue. The learning process not only the technical skills but also get to know different individuals characters and traits.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Why do i want to work with Raisely team over somewhere else?</h4>
												<p>I am excited by the opportunity to work with a team with a boldness to stick with the core vision and mission of the team whatever it takes. I believe with that kind of boldness also grant the attitude to keep moving forward and embrace risk for innovate, getting better principle. I also believe getting onboard into your team will make me thrive and i understand the challenges that high growth in this field of position can make me more advanced to next level for both personal & technical.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>List of tasks i want to talk about.</h4>
												<ul class="feature-icons">
												   <li class="icon solid fa-grin-stars">Excited by work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue. </li> 
                                                                                                   <li class="icon solid fa-grin-stars">Excited by running a training session with a customer to set up their unique campaign. </li>
                                                                                                   <li class="icon solid fa-smile-beam">Want to learn more about create engaging content for social media and digital marketing. </li>

												<h4>Great platforms i'd like to talk about</h4>
												<p>Wikimedia, EDX, and Coursera are educational platform which i believe solved education problem due i used it a lot and gain a lot of knowledge from its. For EDX / Coursera i get education from a lot reputable universities, organizations, etc and they give the access to education for free with only internet boundary. I know both of platform still always need to growing and enhance their delivery education perhaps with more interactive learning class which i believe its getting better and better. For Wikimedia platform due anyone can share their thoughts, knowledges to others with for me opening my mind horizons - off course in science i always believe we should always doubt in order to gain excellency. Those educational platform vision and mission are the key points i believe can bring education to everyone. The other platform is the open source Kubernetes which i still learn and still a lot don't know about it, Kubernetes aim to help developer have more productive release cycles for update frequently with its automation features which includes scheduling for those application components, auto configuration, supervision, and failure handling which part of Kubernetes. Kubernetes usage mainly beneficial in microservices application environment which have multi components layers and can be managed as distributed system by Kubernetes. To be honest for me the complexity of Kubernetes still high as there are a lot new features coming in every release / features which i still don't know about it, i believe in near future Kubernetes community will help decrease those complexities into more simply use (by the fact there are a lot of tools related with Kubernetes platform - kops, envoy, helm, etc).</p>
